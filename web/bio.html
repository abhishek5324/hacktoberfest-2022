            Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] (About this soundlisten);
            12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]),
            was an Indian Hindu monk. He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic
            Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies 
            of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,[6][7] and is credited with raising interfaith
            awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late
            19th century.[8] He was a major force in the contemporary Hindu reform movements in 
            India, and contributed to the concept of Indian nationalism as a tool to fight against
            the British empire in colonial India.[9] Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and 
            the Ramakrishna Mission.
            [7] He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words "Sisters and 
            brothers of America ...,"[10] in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the 
            World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.
